===========================
Get mission statistics in DCS:World - It relies on other scripts created by "xcom".

Check this forum post: http://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=124715

The OP uses php and a database to get the statistics from a CSV file generated by the game. With this script you can bypass the database stuff and just plug in the CSV file.

You still need the code to get the data out of the game and create the CSV file. So you must follow step #3 provided in that post.

## Step #3:

a. Go into your mission, in the initialization script that start with the mission add the following - https://copy.com/0M27qJ8Fj7Co

b. In your mission, do a trigger that runs according to whenever you want to save stats and runs the following script - https://copy.com/xgdLUv0ZfFYK

c. We now need to tell DCS to enable us the option to save a file, go into the following folder - DCS World\Scripts\ and change the marked lines to look as follows in the file - MissionScripting.lua -

```lua
do
	sanitizeModule('os')
	--sanitizeModule('io')
	--sanitizeModule('lfs')
	require = nil
	loadlib = nil
end
```

d. Make sure to create the folder Save_stat in your Saved Games\DCS\Logs folder.

## Running the script:

Run the script, a file dialog pops up, open the mission's CSV file.

If all goes well, the file is parsed, a dialog appears to note success, press OK.

A html file is generated at your desktop with the stats and your browser opens to display it.

Upload or distribute the html file.

## Bugs:

I came across one generated CSV that refused to comply for reasons yet unknown.

## acknowledgements:

This script is based on the work by xcom (http://forums.eagle.ru/member.php?u=90838).

Also the html output is a direct copy of his work.
